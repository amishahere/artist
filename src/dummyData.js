We’re here to help, we’ve written examples of web copy for over 40 industries for you to use at concept phase of your projects to bring a little life and realism to your designs and help you think about who and what you are designing for. We want clients and designers alike to think about their design and how it will work with the web copy, we want you think about how numbers, symbols and bullet points will look. Sure, it's easier to just run down the forms and fill the fields with garbage in order to plow through them quickly. But that's not real. That's not what your customers are going to do. Is it really smart to take a shortcut when customers are forced to take the long road? When you just enter fake copy in rapid-fire fashion, you don't know what it really feels like to fill out that form. Do as your customers do and you'll understand them better. When you understand them better, and feel what they feel, you'll build a better interface.",
